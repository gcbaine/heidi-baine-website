          Philosophy of
          Science</h1>
        <p class="col-8  philP blurb">
          Since the dawn of man, humans have studied their surroundings. Early
          men
          created tools for hunting and farming and domesticated animals to help
          in
          human endeavors. They learned which plants were edible and which were
          toxic.
          This knowledge was passed down from one generation to the next with
          each
          generation adding their discoveries to the growing body of knowledge.
          This
          process of study, build, evaluate, and improve serves as the
          foundation of
          modern science.
        </p>

        <p class="col-8 philP blurb">
          Science is a search for knowledge. Scientists study the earth, her
          environs and her inhabitants, to understand how they fit together.
          They
          monitor the universe, attempting to determine how it came to be and to
          reveal the mysteries it holds. Many scientists devote themselves to
          the
          study of one phenomenon while others seek links between different
          phenomena.
          This pursuit of pure knowledge informs other fields of human endeavor
          like
          engineering and medicine.
        </p>

        <p class="col-8 philP blurb">
          Science is dynamic. With new technologies come new discoveries.
          Scientists
          review each otherâ€™s work, trying to verify original findings.
          Scientists
          disagree, debating in the sphere of competing ideas and experimental
          findings. They find similarities between their work and the work of
          others,
          leading to collaboration to add more weight to their findings. This
          dynamism
          propels discovery forward, adding to our body of knowledge.
        </p>

        <p class="col-8 philP blurb">Human curiosity is the driving
          force
          behind all scientific
          endeavors.
          Scientists want to know why, how, and when this universe and planet
          came
          into being. They find wonder in the world around them and seek to find
          explanations for what they see. As long as humans inhabit this earth,
          science will remain the tool to solve the mysteries of our universe.
